# ✅Assignment 1:
For our first assignment, we have been asked to create the following algorithms:

1. Bubble sort: This sorting technique keeps comparing adjacent elements and swapping their places, resulting in the maximum or minimum element moving to the end of the list.
2. Selection sort: In contrast with bubble sort, selection sort does not change the position of adjacent elements; however, it finds the smallest or biggest element and swaps it with the element in its correct position.
3. Insertion sort: This algorithm divides the dataset into two parts — one sorted and one unsorted. During each pass, an element from the unsorted part is inserted into the sorted part until the unsorted part is empty.

What is common between these sorting algorithms is that their worst-case scenario is **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**. However, the best-case scenario occurs when the lists are already ordered, making the best-case time complexity for bubble and insertion sort **O(n)**. Due to the nature of insertion sort, fewer comparisons are made compared to the other two algorithms, making it faster for small datasets and requiring less running time.

# ✅Assignment 2:
Following the previous assignment, we were asked to implement other sorting algorithms that are much faster.
