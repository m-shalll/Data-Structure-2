# Assignment 1:
For our first assignment we have been asked to create these following algorithms:
1. Bubble sort: this sorting technique keeps comparing adjacent elements together and switching their places, resulting in having
   the maximum/minimum element at the end of the list.
3. Selection sort: on contrast with the bubble sort, selection sort does not change the position of adjacent elements;however, it finds
   the smallest/biggest element and switches it with the element in its position.
5. Insertion sort: divides the data set into parts one that is sorted and one not sorted, during each path an element from the
   unsorted part is inserted in sorted part until the unsorted part is empty.
   
What is common between these sorting algorithms that their worst case scenario is **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**;however, the best case scenraio
is that the lists are already ordered, this will make the best case scenraio for bubble and insertion sort **O(n)**.
However due to the nature of Insertion sort, fewer comparisons are made compared to the other two algorithms making it faster
for small data sets and take less running time.

# Assignment 2:
Following the past assignment we were asked other sorting algorithms but much faster ones
